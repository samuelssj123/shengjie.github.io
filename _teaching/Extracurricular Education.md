  > *I have put together a handy guide for high school students who are struggling with the liberal arts. We know that some concepts can be tricky, and exams can be tough. That's why we've created this helpful resource to make things easier. It's been well-received by students at many different schools, and we're so happy to see it helping them succeed!*
