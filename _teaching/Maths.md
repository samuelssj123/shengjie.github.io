Core Curriculum: *Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Real Variable Function, Operations Research(OR)* Note: I was hired to teach maths to undergraduates as a government-paid teaching students' [partner]({{site.url}}/file/乐学.pdf) at Beijing Normal University.

He has a solid mathematical background. He has won the second prize in the provincial level of the [Mathematics_Competition]({{site.url}}/file/mathematics_competition.pdf) and a provincial award in [Mathematical Modelling]({{site.url}}/file/mathematical_modelling.pdf).

From 2022 to 2024.

Basic Core Course
