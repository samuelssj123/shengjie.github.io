<font color=CornflowerBlue face="Times New Roman">It may be helpful to identify a positive feedback mechanism that aligns with your natural rhythm. You could find me in the study room at 7 AM, or working on the lemon car model with PhD students at 10 PM. My notes were often sought after during finals. In my free time, I enjoyed watching videos on humanities, social sciences, and popular science to cultivate my economic intuition. Whenever I encountered counterintuitive phenomena, I would ponder the underlying reasons.</font>

|[SDG Olympiad Competition]({{site.url}}/file/thu铜.pdf) at Tsinghua University | The workshop was centred around the theme of ‘Planetary Health’, which encouraged campers to explore practical issues and propose potentially viable solutions to accelerate society's progress towards the SDG goals. <br> <br>

<font color=CadetBlue face="Times New Roman">Growing up in a family of educators, I was fortunate to attend a teacher’s college, where I became acutely aware of the vast disparity in educational resources between rural and urban areas. This gap is not merely financial but stems from the teachers’ perspectives and approaches. In rural areas, teachers often adopt a didactic tone, focusing solely on exams and textbook knowledge without exposing students to the broader world and life beyond their village. This limited perspective, akin to the “frog in the well” analogy, hinders students’ academic progress because teachers, lacking real-world experience, cannot effectively convey the “why” behind scientific concepts. I see this as another form of educational inequality—limited vision. This realization motivated me to obtain a teaching certificate and engage in educational activities. <br> <br>

During the summer of my junior year, I volunteered as an English teacher in a nationally designated impoverished county in Henan Province. When I asked the students about their future aspirations, most were at a loss for words, unaware of the world beyond their village and the myriad opportunities it holds. Their vague dreams and limited understanding of the outside world made their learning feel lifeless. As volunteer teachers, our role extended beyond tutoring; we aimed to introduce them to the limitless possibilities life offers. Seeing them reminded me of my younger self. I shared stories of life beyond the village, describing the experiences of living in southern China as depicted in geography textbooks and highlighting the cultural differences and unique activities abroad, which they found astonishing. <br> <br>

Upon returning to campus, I joined a high school tutoring organization, progressing from a teaching assistant to a lecturer. When addressing students from across the country, I used examples from their classes and daily lives, gradually expanding to include broader economic, political, cultural, and geographical knowledge. This approach not only imparted indirect experiential knowledge but also created direct experiential learning opportunities. <br> <br>

Later, at the Tsinghua University SDG Olympiad Competition, I collaborated with friends from Vietnam, Thailand, and other countries to discuss Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We found common ground in addressing educational inequality and proposed developing a metaverse game to help children in impoverished areas experience urban professions, guiding them toward distant goals. We also promoted our project through media platforms, aiming to expand its reach to different regions. We are all committed to spreading and creating equal educational opportunities.</font>

<font color=Olive face="Times New Roman">My journey has been marked by a deep commitment to cultural preservation, community engagement, and inclusive education. Through various projects and leadership roles, I have consistently sought to bridge gaps and foster understanding across diverse communities. <br> <br>
One of my significant endeavors involved working with the Baoan ethnic minority to preserve their cultural heritage, the Baoan waist knives. Facing modern regulations restricting their transport that threatened their existence, our team utilized e-commerce platforms and live streaming to boost sales and created cultural documentaries to enhance their reputation. This project underscored the importance of innovative solutions in cultural preservation. <br> <br>
In Guizhou’s Daozhen County, our team leveraged the region’s unique tourism resources to promote economic development. By engaging in local activities and producing promotional videos, we garnered government support and highlighted the potential of cultural tourism in poverty alleviation. This experience demonstrated the power of media and community-driven initiatives in fostering economic growth. <br> <br>
Additionally, my work with an autistic child revealed the profound impact of tailored educational approaches. By designing activities that allowed him to learn at his own pace, we demonstrated that with the right support, every child can achieve academic success. This taught me the value of empathy, patience, and subtle mentorship. <br> <br>
Beyond these projects, I have actively participated as a volunteer in other activities that has equipped me with comprehensive skills and a drive for continuous improvement. They have enriched my understanding of cross-cultural dynamics and prepared me to contribute meaningfully to diverse academic and professional environments.  <br> <br> </font>
