I come from a county under Qingdao, Shandong Province, where I completed my pre-university education. From county to city, I have developed a propensity for recognizing alternative views, and in doing so I have come to appreciate the importance of helping those less represented and
underprivileged.

# Academic Excellence: Leading by 6 Points and Exceeding Expectations

I completed my undergraduate studies at Beijing Normal University from Sep 2021 to June 2025. During the first three years of my undergraduate studies, I completed a rigorous curriculum of core courses, followed by project-based learning in the fourth year. My academic ranking was based on the grades from these core courses, which I have highlighted on my [English transcript]({{site.url}}/file/本科生英文成绩单.pdf). At the end of my undergraduate program, I received a comprehensive transcript covering all four years of coursework. I graduated with an [average GPA]({{site.url}}/file/Shengjie_SONG's_Grade_at_bachalor.pdf) that surpassed the second-highest score by six points, securing the top rank in my class and earning the highest level of scholarship.

## Personal Story

<font face="STCAIYUN">It may be helpful to identify a positive feedback mechanism that aligns with your natural rhythm. You could find me in the study room at 7 AM, or working on the lemon car model with PhD students at 10 PM. My notes were often sought after during finals. In my free time, I enjoyed watching videos on humanities, social sciences, and popular science to cultivate my economic intuition. Whenever I encountered counterintuitive phenomena, I would ponder the underlying reasons.</font>
