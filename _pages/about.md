I am currently an Research Assistant, FTEC Thrust, Society Hub, Hong Kong University of Secience and Technology([HKUST-GZ](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/zh/?variant=zh-cn)), supervise by Prof. [Yi Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/yzhangone/home).

I recived my Bachelor's Degree in Bay Area International Business School of Finance Technology([BIBS](https://bibs.bnu.edu.cn/)), Beijing Normal University([BNU](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/)). In my third year as an undergraduate, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to study under Prof. [Meng Han](https://bibs.bnu.edu.cn/teachers/qzjs/587d80e0309b4d559299abec5d16924b.htm) who is an excellent teacher, guiding me to the academic path.

My research interest includes Empirical Asset Pricing, Empirical Finance, Education and Macroeconomics, Applied Machine Learning. In particular, how political, climatic, educational and other social events affect asset values.

My goal is to study how phenomena in the humanities and social spheres affect the value of financial assets, in order to hopefully achieve financial inclusion. I am seeking a RA or Ph.D. position, starting from now or 4 years later,respectively.
