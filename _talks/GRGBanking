I interned at the Research Institute of GRGBanking Equipment Co., Ltd., serving as an intern in the Data Elements Group and participating in project design and development from March 2025.


**Project Description**: Developed a privacy computing platform for data spaces, enabling each node to train a global model through federated learning by sharing parameters rather than raw data.  

## Privacy Computing × Healthcare  

Addressed the issue of medical data silos by designing a deployment scheme for federated learning in biomedical imaging. The work included:  

- Technical Comparisons: Analyzed federated learning, secure multi-party computation, and trusted execution environment to identify suitable privacy-preserving approaches for medical data collaboration.  

- Algorithm Research: Conducted in-depth studies on mainstream algorithms such as Densenet201, ViT, and ResNet50 for biomedical image classification, optimizing their application in medical scenarios.  

- Tool Integration: Introduced open-source annotation and segmentation tools (e.g., CVAT) to streamline data preprocessing and labeling for medical images.  

- Cross-Modal Capability: Leveraged the dual-tower architecture of MedImageInsight to implement image-text cross-modal retrieval and automated report generation.  

- User Testing: Conducted testing to validate the platform’s usability, model performance, and privacy protection mechanisms in real-world healthcare scenarios.
