[CodePath](https://samuelssj123.github.io/#page-top) is a meticulously crafted self-guided learning program designed to help individuals master algorithms and their advanced applications. Updating...

Drawing inspiration from the proven methodologies of [Code Caprice](https://space.bilibili.com/525438321?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0) and [Learning Deep Learning with Mu Li](https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0), the program is enriched with my personal contributions, including detailed handwritten notes, high-quality lecture recordings, and thoughtful reflections. 

It offers a comprehensive, step-by-step roadmap for learners to progress from foundational concepts to advanced expertise, making it an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to excel in the field of algorithms.
