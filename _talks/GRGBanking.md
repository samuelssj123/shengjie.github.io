He interned at the Research Institute of [GRGBanking](https://global.grgbanking.com/en/) Equipment Co., Ltd., serving as an intern in the Data Elements Group and participating in project design and development from March 2025.


**Project Description**: Developed a privacy computing platform for data spaces, enabling each node to train a global model through federated learning by sharing parameters rather than raw data.  

- Privacy Computing × Healthcare: Addressed medical data silos by designing a federated learning platform for biomedical imaging. Compared federated learning, secure multi-party computation, and trusted execution environments. Conducted in-depth research on mainstream algorithms (Densenet201, ViT, ResNet50) for medical image classification. Integrated open-source tools (e.g., CVAT) for annotation and segmentation. Implemented cross-modal image-text retrieval and report generation via MedImageInsight’s dual-tower architecture. Produced one in-depth passage. Conducted a comparison of machine learning testing under Federated Learning and TEE environments, wrote platform testing and server utilization reports, and proposed over 10 vulnerabilities and improvements.​

- Data Value Evaluation: Designed a three-stage data pricing product, integrating national data quality standards and user cost-value analysis. Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Game Theory Approach for quotation formulation. Leveraged the Qirana-SQL pricing system, improved Shapley value, Dealer framework, and zero-payment models, combined with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), federated learning, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy. Developed valuation schemes for one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many scenarios between data owners and purchasers. Proposed a bargaining iteration scheme inspired by stock market transaction mechanisms.

**Others project**: Participated in the defense of the cross-border multi-level trade data security circulation system in cooperation with Macau, responsible for writing defense scripts and minutes; Participated in the research on investment promotion and operation pain points of a cross-border e-commerce industrial park in a border city, used the Coffee Index to improve RMB pricing power, and enabled cross-border e-commerce with Digital RMB.
