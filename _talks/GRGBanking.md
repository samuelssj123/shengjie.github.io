He interned at the Research Institute of [GRGBanking](https://global.grgbanking.com/en/) Equipment Co., Ltd., serving as an intern in the Data Elements Group and participating in project design and development from March 2025.


**Project Description**: Developed a privacy computing platform for data spaces, enabling each node to train a global model through federated learning by sharing parameters rather than raw data.  

- Privacy Computing × Healthcare: Addressed medical data silos by designing a federated learning platform for biomedical imaging. Compared federated learning, secure multi-party computation, and trusted execution environments. Conducted in-depth research on mainstream algorithms (Densenet201, ViT, ResNet50) for medical image classification. Integrated open-source tools (e.g., CVAT) for annotation and segmentation. Implemented cross-modal image-text retrieval and report generation via MedImageInsight’s dual-tower architecture, followed by user testing.

- Data Value Evaluation: Designed a three-stage data pricing product, integrating national data quality standards and user cost-value analysis. Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Game Theory Approach for quotation formulation. Leveraged the Qirana-SQL pricing system, improved Shapley value, Dealer framework, and zero-payment models, combined with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), federated learning, secure multi-party computation, and differential privacy. Developed valuation schemes for one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many scenarios between data owners and purchasers. Proposed a bargaining iteration scheme inspired by stock market transaction mechanisms.
