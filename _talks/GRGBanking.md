He interned at the Research Institute of [GRGBanking](https://global.grgbanking.com/en/) Equipment Co., Ltd., serving as an intern in the Data Elements Group and participating in project design and development from March 2025.


**Project Description**: Developed a privacy computing platform for data spaces, enabling each node to train a global model through federated learning by sharing parameters rather than raw data.  

- Privacy Computing × Healthcare: Addressed medical data silos by designing a federated learning platform for biomedical imaging. Compared federated learning, secure multi-party computation, and trusted execution environments. Conducted in-depth research on mainstream algorithms (Densenet201, ViT, ResNet50) for medical image classification. Integrated open-source tools (e.g., CVAT) for annotation and segmentation. Implemented cross-modal image-text retrieval and report generation via MedImageInsight’s dual-tower architecture, followed by user testing.

- Federated Learning Contribution Assessment: Developed a framework to quantify data element values across nodes by comparing Shapley value, gradient-based, game theory, and deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
