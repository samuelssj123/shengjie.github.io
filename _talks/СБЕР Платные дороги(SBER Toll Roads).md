Personal Story

<font face="Times New Roman">When I first interacted with my new Russian colleagues, the main barriers were language and culture. Humorously, we joked that even though we were face-to-face, we could still plot in our native languages and then conspire in English. Culturally, assisting a Moscow bank with proposals for toll roads was challenging. We initially thought we could simply apply successful Chinese models, but as they explained the Russian context, we realized their development was far beyond our expectations. Despite these differences, we found common ground and successfully completed this international collaboration.</font>
