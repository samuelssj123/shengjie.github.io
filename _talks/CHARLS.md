Personal Story

<font face="Times New Roman">As a field interviewer for CHARLS, I have had the privilege of experiencing firsthand the diverse lives of the elderly in China.In the scorching heat of rural Shandong, where the ground was hot enough to cook an egg, my team and I sought refuge in a local home to avoid heatstroke. In the urban villages of Guangzhou, I met migrant workers living in a single-room rental for just 600 RMB and had to go downstairs a long way to shower and use the toilet. While following up with a worker in Dongguan, I witnessed the profound love she had for her husband when she saw his recent photo on my tablet and eagerly asked to take a picture of it with her phone. <br>    <br>

In academic papers, these individuals might be reduced to mere data points, excluded for missing responses. However, those of us who have conducted fieldwork understand that data cleaning must be done with empathy and respect for the people behind the numbers.</font>
